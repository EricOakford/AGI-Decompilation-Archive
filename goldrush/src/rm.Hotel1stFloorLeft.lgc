[***********************************************************[[ rm.Hotel1stFloorLeft[ [ This room is the interior hallway on the first floor, [ left side, of the hotel Green Pastures. There is nothing[ for Jerrod to do here.[[ This room uses a timer to dismiss message windows used in[ the knocking sequence; but since none of the print [ commands in the sequence use the leaveWindow flag, none of [ those print commands actually need to be dismissed; [ it's a bug.
